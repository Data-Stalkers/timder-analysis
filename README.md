    end_date: '2017-10-8'
  }
```

#### Output
```javascript

   weight_id: INT,
   user_id: INT,
   photo_count_weight: {
     0: INT,
     1: INT,
     2: INT,

   }
 }
```

- `user_id` User's specific ID number
- `photo_count_weight` User's calculated weights for photo count

##### Additional Information:
The calculated weights table is generated by joining Event Service, Swipes, and User Info tables. The photo_count_weight number will be calculated by measuring a specific user with X amount of photos to user matches for a given time range. Each photo count will have a weight attributed to it and based on how much weight is given, the Match service will prioritize and sort user cards accordingly.
